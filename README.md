# SpeedTracer

A simple ray tracer I made to beat Eric. That was its sole purpose. Pretty fun to make though, and definitely worth it.

Has seperate CPU and GPU archetectures for rendering however when I started on the GPU one, I never got around to updating the cpu one. The GPU one is just objectivly better.

### Features:
  Renders a definable scene containing spheres
  Designed so triangles, and meshes could be added in the futrue.
  Press left click to switch between the cpu and gpu renders.
  The cpu version is saved to result.png
  Metalic, Emmisive, and Lambertian (only albedo) Materials.
  An optional rotating camera
